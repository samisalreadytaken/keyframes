2023-11-24 [v1.3.2]

2022-05-19 [v1.2.9]

	Compiling the same set of keyframes will result in slightly different precision values
	while keeping the same practical values due to the change in sampling calculations.

- Fixed keyframe selection changing while looking too far away
- Fixed engine view interpolation

2021-10-05 [v1.2.7]

- Fixed initial FOV not being saved and set on path data
- Removed default fallback of 'kf_save' command

2021-09-09 [v1.2.6]
- Updated vs_library v2.43.2

2021-08-27 [v1.2.5]

- Fixed compilation and precision bugs. This will now give more accurate results.
- Added kf_preview for playing the path without compiling
- Replaced 3D keyframe drawing with 2D filled rectangles
- Added distance based keyframe frustum drawing
- Added distance based keyframe rectangle scaling
- Optimised path drawing
